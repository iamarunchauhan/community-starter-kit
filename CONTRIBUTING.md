### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: The code in which you seems to be a need of development to make it more robust
- **qa-needed**: If question and answers are required to explain the topic
- **documentation-needed**: Documentation is required to understand the code & it's implementation procedure
- **bug-high-priority**: The :bug: which will of hig priority & need to be solve as soon as possible
- **bug-low-priority**: :bug: which are of low priority & can be solved later
- **help-wanted**: Need a help in some part of a code

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
